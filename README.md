CURRENT BUILD 0.8.4a_dev<br>
please bear in mind that polycode is still in its BETA stages, with no current binary builds. you only current build through the terminal. but this MAC build gives people the chance to try and see what polycode can do. if there are any problems with this particular MAC build, please do get back in touch with myself, rather than on polycode - since it was myself who has made the build, but was given permission to release this BETA build. bugs are more than likely going to be in the BETA, thats why its BETA.<br>but these are actively being looked for and thwarted. so later builds will become better and better.
but just have fun, and keep your eyes open for more builds with polycode

have ph√ºn
